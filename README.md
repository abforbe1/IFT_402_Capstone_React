# ElectricDriver.net

This is the github repository for ElectricDriver.net - my Senior Capstone Design Project

**My project is currently live at [electricdriver.net](https://electricdriver.net/)**

I designed and built this project in IFT 401 and IFT 402 (respectively) during my senior year at Arizona State University.

## Project Description
Currently, popular car buying websites lack sufficient detailed information on Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles (PHEVs).

**Technology Solution**: a database of information related to EVs and a fluid, responsive website – built using React.js - that allows users to access and interact with the data.

**Stakeholders**: Prospective EV and PHEV car buyers, enthusiasts, and the average consumer who are curious, but don’t know much about EVs or PHEVs.

### Features
**Search**: The user can search and filter through a detailed information database of the most popular and upcoming EVs and PHEVs

**Learn**: basic information and concepts about EVs organized into approachable and digestible chunks – geared at informing less knowledgeable viewers.

**Explore**: Curated content from social media sites, news outlets, and various content creators that are interesting and relevant to EV enthusiasts.


### Future Work
- I'm currently working on adding more functionality to filtering and sorting the results page
- Allow users to compare EV models side by side
- Change layout to be more intuitive and easily navigable for new users and people new to EVs.

### Technologies Used
NodeJS, git, ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Tableau
